`passgenr` is a Rust library for generating cryptographically-secure random
passwords. It is a port of my earlier password generating tool,
[passgen](https://github.com/defuse/passgen) (which was written in C).
`passgenr` also includes a command-line utility for generating passwords. Please
read the [Security Details](#security-details) section below.

## Command-Line Utility

To build and install the command-line utility, run...

```
cargo build --bin passgenr --release
```

...and then install the `./target/release/passgenr` into your system.

Here are some examples of how to use the command-line tool:

```
$ passgenr --ascii

$ passgenr --alpha

## Library

This library is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/passgenr). The
documentation is hosted [on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/passgenr/).

To use the library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`...

```
[dependencies]
passgenr = "0.2"
```

...and add this line to your crate root...

```
extern crate passgenr;
```

...now you can generate a password...

```
assert_eq!(
    20,
    passgenr::random_password(passgenr::charsets::ASCII, 20, "").unwrap().len()
);
```

## Security Details

**Randomness.** `passgenr` uses [OsRng](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rand/rand/struct.OsRng.html)
as a randomness source, which reads directly from the operating system's CSPRNG
(e.g. `getrandom(2)` or `/dev/urandom` on Linux, or `RtlGenRandom` on Windows).
The individual elements of the password (characters or words) are selected by
calling `.choose()` on the `OsRng`, which is careful to sample uniformly (i.e.
it doesn't use the naive "mod N" algorithm).

**Swap File.** `passgenr` does not prevent its memory from being written out to
the system's swap file. You should only use `passgenr` on systems with an
encrypted swap file/partition.

**Side-Channels.** Unlike the older `passgen`, `passgenr` has no defenses
against side-channel attacks. When you generate passwords with `passgenr` you
should be sure that nobody untrustworthy can run code on the same machine (even
as an unprivileged user), otherwise they might be able to extract some
information about the passwords through side-channels. Adding side-channel
defenses to `passgenr` is
[planned](https://github.com/defuse/passgenr/issues/4), once the technology
becomes available to stable Rust.

**Audit Status.** While its author is careful and prioritizes security,
`passgenr` has not yet been audited by a professional third-party. If you have
experience doing security audits and you would like to contribute one, please
get in touch!
